			<h1>Introduction to Exoplanets</h1>
			<p>Welcome to "Stellar Quest", a narrative exploration into the captivating world of exoplanets. For
				centuries, humans have
				looked up at the night sky, wondering about the myriad worlds that might exist beyond our solar system.
				With the advent
				of modern telescopes and space missions, we've embarked on an incredible journey of discovery, finding
				thousands of
				exoplanets—planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system. These distant worlds come in a wide
				range of
				compositions and characteristics, from rocky planets like Earth to gas giants like Jupiter. While direct
				imaging is
				rare, astronomers employ various indirect methods, such as measuring the dimming of stars during
				planetary transits or
				observing subtle Doppler shifts in starlight, allowing us to discover and analyze these incredible
				exoplanets. One
				notable example is the TRAPPIST-1 system, where seven Earth-sized planets have been identified and
				studied based on
				their influence on each other's orbits and the properties of their host star. Through these discoveries,
				we gain
				invaluable insights not only into these intriguing alien worlds but also into our own home planet and
				its place in the
				vast cosmic arena. In this interactive visual journey, we invite you to explore the fascinating
				diversity and patterns
				found in the exoplanets we've discovered so far.</p>

			<h1>Navigating the Cosmic Spectrum: From Earth to Gas Giants</h1>
			<p>Embark on an enlightening voyage through the vast expanse of known exoplanets. In this interactive
				scatter plot, each
				dot represents an exoplanet, with its position determined by its mass and radius. Starting from our home
				planet, Earth,
				we journey through the different categories of exoplanets: Terrestrial, Super-Earth, Neptunian, and the
				Gas
				Giants. Observe the patterns and distributions, and hover over each point to view details about
				individual planets.</p>

			<h1>Exploring Exoplanets: Mass, Radius, and Host Star Spectral Types</h1>
			<p>Dive into the vast expanse of our universe as we visualize the relationship between the mass and radius
				of known
				exoplanets. This interactive scatter plot groups exoplanets based on the spectral type of their host
				star, shedding
				light on the diverse range of celestial bodies that lie beyond our solar system. From red dwarfs to the
				hot
				O-type stars, observe the intriguing patterns that emerge as you explore. And as a touchstone, Earth –
				with its G-type
				host star, the Sun – is also plotted for context. Use the on-screen navigation to focus on different
				star types and
				unearth details about each category. As you hover over each data point, uncover the name, mass, and
				radius
				of the planet, as well as the spectral type of its host star.</p>

			<h1>Comparative Exploration of Exoplanets</h1>
			<p>In our quest to understand the universe, exoplanets — planets outside our solar system — have always
				intrigued us. This
				visualization delves deep into the characteristics of known exoplanets, focusing on their mass and
				radius, especially
				those comparable to Earth. The exoplanets have been filtered to represent only those that orbit stars of
				spectral type
				G, K, and M, akin to our Sun and other cooler dwarf stars. A highlighted region represents exoplanets
				with a mass
				ranging from 0.8 to 2 times that of Earth, often considered pivotal in the search for life-sustaining
				conditions. These
				planets may possess a solid surface and an atmosphere conducive to life as we know it. By navigating
				through the plotted
				data points, one can gain insights into the equilibrium temperature, density, and distance from Earth
				for each
				exoplanet.</p>
